Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience working on a machine learning project where I built a stock price prediction model using Python and several powerful libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, TensorFlow, and more. It was quite the journey!

First off, I gathered historical data on Google and Tesla stock prices. Then, armed with Jupyter Notebook, I dove into the world of data preprocessing using pandas and numpy. These libraries were lifesavers for cleaning up the data, handling missing values, and preparing it for analysis.

Next came the fun partâ€”exploring the data and visualizing trends using matplotlib and plotly. Plotting graphs helped me gain insights into the stock price movements over time, which was crucial for understanding the patterns that my model would later learn.

Once I had a solid grasp of the data, I delved into building the prediction model using TensorFlow. This part required a bit of experimentation and fine-tuning to find the optimal architecture for my neural network. But with persistence and some trial and error, I finally trained a model that could predict future stock prices with reasonable accuracy.

Throughout the process, I encountered challenges and setbacks, like dealing with overfitting and optimizing model performance. But each hurdle was a learning opportunity, and with each iteration, my understanding of machine learning grew stronger.

In the end, seeing my model make predictions and comparing them to actual stock prices was incredibly rewarding. It was a reminder of the power of data and the endless possibilities of machine learning. I'm excited to continue exploring this fascinating field and taking on new projects in the future.
